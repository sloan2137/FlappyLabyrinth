<h1 align="center"> FlappyLabyrinth </h1>

FlappyLabyrinth is a game that combines Flappy Bird with a maze solver, written in **Python** using **PyGame**.
## Gameplay
You play normal Flappy Bird, flying forward and avoiding obstacles, but sometimes you encounter _sprites_ which need your help with solving a maze. You have a limited amount of time to solve the maze, and if you run out of it, you lose one life. To complete a game, you must help _5_ _sprites_ (solve _5_ mazes). You of course also die if you touch an obstacle (in Flappy Bird state).
